Dice Rolling System
The program mimics rolling a dice, providing random results and an option to roll again.
[Let’s create a Dice-Rolling Simulator in Python! This program simulates rolling a dice, generating a random number between 1 and 6, or more for multi-sided dice.]
Features of This Program
1.	Random Number Generation: Simulates rolling a dice using the random module.
2.	Customizable Dice: Allows the user to specify the number of sides for the dice.
3.	Roll Again Option: Lets the user roll the dice multiple times in one session.
4.	Input Validation: Ensures the user provides valid input for the number of sides.
________________________________________
How It Works
1.	The user specifies the number of sides for the dice (e.g., 6 for a standard dice, 20 for a D20 in tabletop games).
2.	The program rolls the dice and displays the result.
3.	The user can choose to roll again or exit the simulator.
________________________________________
Run the Code
•	Save the code in a Python file (e.g., dice_rolling_simulator.py).
•	Run it in your terminal or IDE.
•	Specify the dice type and roll to see random outcomes.

Project: Password Generator
[Let’s create a Password Generator in Python! This program generates strong, random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as length and character types.]
The program lets the user customize the password by choosing its length and including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Features of This Program
1.	Customizable Password:
o	User can specify the password length.
o	Options to include/exclude uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
2.	Randomized Password: Ensures high security by using the random module for character selection.
3.	Input Validation: Checks for minimum password length and ensures at least one character type is selected.
________________________________________
How It Works
1.	The user specifies the desired password length and character types.
2.	The program combines the selected character pools (e.g., lowercase, numbers) and generates a random password of the given length.
3.	The password is displayed to the user.
________________________________________
Run the Code
•	Save the code in a Python file (e.g., password_generator.py).
•	Run it in your terminal or IDE.
•	Follow the prompts to generate a secure password.

Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
[Let’s create a Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Python! This classic game allows two players to play on a 3x3 grid, with one player using "X" and the other using "O".]
This is a text-based version of Tic-Tac-Toe where players take turns marking the grid until someone wins or the game ends in a draw.
Features of This Game
1.	Two-Player Mode: Players "X" and "O" alternate turns.
2.	Dynamic Board: The board updates after each move and is displayed to the players.
3.	Win and Draw Detection:
o	Checks rows, columns, and diagonals for a winner.
o	Declares a draw if the board is full with no winner.
4.	Input Validation: Ensures valid moves and prevents overwriting existing marks.
________________________________________
How It Works
1.	Players take turns to input the row and column numbers (0, 1, 2) to place their marks.
2.	The board is updated and displayed after each move.
3.	The game ends when one player gets three in a row or the board is full.
