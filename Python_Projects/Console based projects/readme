Simple Calculator
This program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
[Let’s create a Simple Calculator project in Python! Here's a step-by-step implementation]
Features of This Calculator
1.	Addition: Adds two numbers.
2.	Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
3.	Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
4.	Division: Divides the first number by the second (checks for division by zero).
5.	Exit Option: Allows the user to exit the program.
________________________________________
How It Works
1.	The user selects an operation (1-5).
2.	The program asks for two numbers.
3.	It performs the selected operation and displays the result.
4.	The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.
________________________________________
Run the Code
•	Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., calculator.py).
•	Run it in your terminal or IDE.
•	Test it with various operations and inputs.

Number Guessing Game
The program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it within a given number of attempts. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
[Let’s create a Number Guessing Game in Python. This fun game allows the user to guess a randomly generated number with hints provided.]
Features of This Game
1.	Random Number Generation: The program picks a random number between 1 and 100 using the random module.
2.	Hints: Tells the user if their guess is too high or too low.
3.	Limited Attempts: The user has 10 attempts to guess the number.
4.	Winning and Losing Messages: Displays appropriate messages based on whether the user guesses the number or runs out of attempts.
________________________________________
How It Works
1.	The program generates a random number when it starts.
2.	The user guesses a number, and the program gives feedback (Too high, Too low, or Correct).
3.	The game ends if the user guesses correctly or exhausts all attempts.
________________________________________
Run the Code
•	Save the code in a Python file (e.g., number_guessing_game.py).
•	Run it in your terminal or IDE.
•	Play the game by guessing numbers and see if you can win!

Text Based Adventure Game
In this game, the player embarks on an adventure where their choices determine the story's outcome.
[Let’s create a Text-Based Adventure Game in Python! This game uses storytelling and player choices to navigate through a fictional adventure.]
Features of This Game
1.	Simple Storyline: The player chooses paths and faces different scenarios.
2.	Interactive Choices: User inputs guide the flow of the game.
3.	Multiple Endings: The story has several outcomes based on the player's choices.
4.	Replayability: Players can restart and try different choices.
________________________________________
How It Works
1.	The player begins the game with a brief introduction and options to choose from.
2.	Each choice leads to a unique scenario and further choices.
3.	The game ends with either a victory or a "Game Over" message.
________________________________________
Run the Code
•	Save the code in a Python file (e.g., text_adventure_game.py).
•	Run it in your terminal or IDE.
•	Follow the prompts and make choices to navigate the adventure.

Extensions and Enhancements
Here are some ideas to expand the game:
•	Add more paths and scenarios for a richer story.
•	Include random events to make the game unpredictable.
•	Track health points, items collected, or a score system.
•	Create a map to visualize the player’s journey.
